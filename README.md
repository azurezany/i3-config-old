# Picom modifications
in `~/.config/picom.conf`
1. **Shadow Exclusion**: (for firefox, polybar) Find the line `"class_g = 'Firefox' && argb",` and replace it with
```
"class_g = 'firefox'",
```
and
```
"class_g = 'Polybar'",
```
This is not useful for me, as I disabled all shadows with `shadow = false;`
2. **Alacritty translucent/transparent**: Add this line in `picom.conf` under `opacity-rule`
```
"80:class_g ; 'Alacritty'"
```
where 80 is the value of opacity out of 100.

# Getting rounded corners on a default install
Run these commands:

```
sudo pacman -Rdd i3-gaps && yay -S i3-gaps-rounded-git
```

and then add a `border_radius x` line in `~/.i3/config`
